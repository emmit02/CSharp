# C# Small Projects with Collection Frameworks in DataGridView
This repository contains small projects developed in C# that utilize collection frameworks to manage and display data dynamically in DataGridView controls. The projects demonstrate practical implementations of collections like List, Dictionary, and Queue, showcasing how they can be synchronized with UI elements for real-time updates and interactions.

Features:
Efficient data handling using collection frameworks.
Real-time synchronization with DataGridView.
Practical examples of working with collections in a GUI environment.
Feel free to explore the projects to understand and learn more about the integration of collection frameworks with Windows Forms applications in C#. ðŸ˜Š
